## PROFILE
I have two years of experience in web design and three years in testing.
  
During my work as a web designer I developed adaptive websites for a wide range of companies, made different advertising products, graphic content and did everything possible to make the product convenient for our clients and their clients too.  
  
But then I thought that I wanted to know how to work in a big company, and wanted to know something new and I got a job in Yandex as a tester.  
  
It was a very useful and important experience, but after all I realized that I'm more interested in creating a product. I really like to see the result of what I do because it really motivates me.  
  
Thatâ€™s why I decided to try JavaScript. And it turned out to be really captivating for me. So I have a strong intention to learn and master it. But I'm sure that all my experience will help me in my future work.  
  
I've just finished a Stage 0 of JavaScript/Front-end course by RS School and have started a Stage 1.  
My current goal is to grow professionally and further improve my skills.

Subtract one list from another and return the result:    
    
```javascript
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    return a.filter(el => !b.includes(el));
}

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]); // result = [2]
arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]); // result = [1,3]
```
    
#### [Digital root](https://www.codewars.com/kata/541c8630095125aba6000c00)
Find the recursive sum of all the digits in a number:    
    
```javascript
function digital_root(n) {
    let result = 0;
    while (n) {
      result += n % 10;
      n = Math.floor(n / 10);
    }
    return result < 10 ? result : digital_root(result);
}

digital_root(16) // result = 7
digital_root(456) // result = 6
```
